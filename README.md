# Twitter-Analysis
I'll be placing scripts and script fragments here that I've used for analyzing Tweets that relate to sake (beverage). Whatever I put up here will be the *analysis* scripts, not the data collection. A non-exhaustive list of options for data collection are below. Choose what best fits your problem.

* Sign up for a Twitter developer account and use their API (easy but limits the timeframe of searches to recent history)
* Twitterscraper (well built Python package that has command-line-interface, easy to use and not limited in timeframe)
* Pay a company for historical Twitter data ($â€”$$$)

## Contents

* List of user locations that are uninformative or in some way give bad geocoding. Includes associated R code for removal.
